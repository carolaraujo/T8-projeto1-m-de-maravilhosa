                            rarely seen without her Mehve or her companion, Teto the fox-squirrel. Some believe her to

                Early years
                Nausicaä moved to the Valley of the Wind with her family when she was very young. Her mother had died
                around that time as well.

                Nausicaä and an Ohmu

                She has a close relationship with her father King Jhil and tries to help him as his health declines due
                to the Valley's proximity to the Sea of Corruption.

                Eventually, Nausicaä starts training to fly her Mehve, which she becomes very good at. She also spends
                alot of time in the Sea of Corruption and experiments with its plants to find out why Jhil's health is
                suffering. As part of this, she secretely grows forest plants in uncorrupted soil, discovering that it
                is not deadly.

                Arrival of the Torumekians Edit
                On one of her expeditions into the Rotwood, Nausicaä discoveres the shell of an Ohmu. These are very
                valuble as building material. After retrieving the eye-shell, she feels the anger of the forest
                creatures. When she investigates, she finds Lord Yupa being chased by several forest creatures,
                including the Ohmu that had shed its shell. Nausicaä leads Yupa to the valley, where he reports on the
                situation in the world abroad.

                Nausicaä goes on patrol with the Valley Gunship, newly refitted with the Ohmu eye-piece, but once again
                feels the forest's anger. This time it is a brig from Pejite. The brig crash-lands, killing everyone
                except for princess Rastel. Rastel gives Nausicaä a stone before she dies though Nausicaä is not aware
                of the stone's significance. She warns Nausicaä that Torumekia invaded Pejitei, even though they are
                formally allied and that the Torumekians want the stone.


                    <img class= "IMG_center_text" src="/IMG/nausicaa.jpg" alt="Nausicaä">


                Shortly after Nausicaä and the Valley's inhabitants have time to ponder the meaning of Rastel's arrival,
                Kushana and her Torumekian soldiers arrive. Kushana asks for the stone, but Nausicaä wants her to leave
                the valley. Kushana eventually relents. Nausicaä is forced to burn part of their fields, as the
                Torumekians contaminated it by bringing miasma.

                Departure for War Edit
                Soon, the Torumekians went to war against the Dorok principalities. Kushana called for the States of the
                Periphery to follow the ancient treaties and assemble at an aerial rendevouz point. Jhil is confined to
                his bed from the poisoning, so he talks to Nausicaä and decide she should go in his stead. This worries
                Lord Yupa, but even Yupa realizes this is the only option. Nausicaä leaves with Mito and the Valley
                Gunship and they travel to the rendevouz point on the edge of the Sea of Corruption. On the way they
                meet people from other periphery states.

                At the rendevouz point, Kushana takes control and starts heading across the Sea of Corruption. They are
                soon attacked by Asbel of Pejite, however, who destroys several ships and seperates the Valley gunship
                from the brig. Nausicaä wants to rescue the other people from her valley and follows them into the Sea
                of Corruption. There they land in an Ohmu nest, but she manages to calm and communicate with them. She
                has the barge reconnected, but wants to head out to rescue Asbel, who has enraged the insects. She takes
                her Mehve and finds him in deep cavities under the forest.

                Asbel discoveres her identity and takes the control stone, which Nausicaä had been carrying. Nausicaä
                wakes up, discovers the petrified forest and guesses that the Sea of Corruption exists to clense the
                lands of human pollution. Asbel and Nausicaä escape, only to be captured by Doroks of the Mani tribe.

                Battle of the Acid Lakes Edit
                Nausicaä meets the Holy One, leader of the Mani Tribe, and Ketcha, who speaks the common tongue. She
                realizes that Kushana has been betrayed and begs to be able to negotiate a peaceful solution. The Holy
                One disagrees and Nausicaä tries to escape. Asbel decides to stay behind to enable Nausicaä to travel
                faster. Nausicaä joins the Valley Gunship and alerts them of the impending destruction through the herd
                of Ohmu. The gunship goes to warn Kushana's army, while Nausicaä decides to take on the Dorok flying jar
                that is baiting the Ohmu herd with a wounded Ohmu.

                Nausicaä confronts the Dorok soldiers and forces them to drop the Ohmu larvae on an island in the acid
                lake. She communicates with the Ohmu and tries to ease its pain. Meanwhile, the Ohmu herd crushes
                Kushana's army and several groups of Mani Tribe warriors and only Kushana's ship manages to escape. The
                Holy One is appalled at this massacre. Nausicaä begs Kushana to take the Ohmu larvae to the herd and
                Kushana relents, since Nausicaä knows the location of the control stone. Nausicaä communicates with the
                Ohmu herd and they depart for the "Southern Forest", which they believe is in need of them. The Holy One
                is reminded of a pre-Holy Empire prophecy by the scene, believing Nausicaä to be a savior that restores
                balance between humanity and the nature.

                The Valley Gunship decides to return to the Valley of the Wind, but Nausicaä decides to continue south
                with Kushana as she sees the Ohmu herd heading south as a sign of bad things to come.

                The Dorok Principalities Edit
                Kushana's Corvette reaches Dorok, which is in a state of war. They discover a village being burned by
                Torumekian troops. Landing, they discover the entire population dead of miasma inhalation except for two
                babies. Nausicaä rescues them (over Kurotowa's objections). The town well had been occupied by Hamushi,
                attracted by miasma. Although the insect takes Nausicaä into its mouth, the Ohmu blood that stains her
                clothes protects her from being eaten.

                Travelling further from the Sea of Corruption they reach the city of Sapata, a Dorok town, occupied by
                the Torumekian third army, but besieged by Dorok infantry and artillery. The third army is loyal to
                Kushana, but is being poorly led by her older brother. Kushana breaks the siege, to fly into to city to
                take command. Inside, Nausicaä discovers the Dorok townspeople are being held captive, to be sold as
                slaves. She asks Kushana for their release. Kushana agrees only on the condition that Nausicaä fights
                alongside her.

                Meanwhile Miralupa the brother of the Dorok Emperor has joined the besieging troops but must bath to
                repair his skin. A skilful warrior monk named Charuka tends to him. Kushana plans to break out from the
                city, destroy the Dorok artillery and buy time for an escape to be made from the city. Nausicaä rides
                with her as promised, and displays her usefulness in war by using siren shells to panic the Dorok War
                beasts used as cavellry. Nausicaä's horseclaw, Kai, is mortally wounded, by troops lead by Charuka. Both
                Charuka and Miralupa believe Nausicaä to be the "blue-clad one" of prophesy.

                Having secured the release of the Dorok prisoners, Nausicaä leaves Sapata and heads deeper into Dorok
                territory, coming to a temple by an oasis. A small boy appears. The boy, Chikuku leads Nausicaä to a
                tomb in which the bodies of many monks are sitting as if in meditation. One monk is still alive and
                communicates telepathically with Nausicaä. He tells her of the prophesy of the blue-clad one, and of the
                secrets stored in the crypts of Shuwa. He foretells the destructions and purification of the world.
                Nausicaä refuses to give up, believing that life is worth saving. A Hebikera flies overhead, and
                Nausicaä realises that the oasis will soon be overcome by miasma. Returning to the tomb she finds the
                monk dead. She leaves on Mehve with Chikuku.

                Airborne, she discovers a Dorok ship being overcome by fungus. The fungus is different from the forest
                trees. In fact it has been bred by Doroks to use as a weapon. But spores became unstable, and are
                consuming the ship which was carrying them. This ship also holds Miralupa and Charuka. Nausicaä lands on
                the upper deck, and once again does battle with the disembodied spirit of Miralupa. The battle is ended
                inconclusively by the attack of insects, and Miralupa is able to escape. Nausicaä joins Charuka battling
                the mutant mould. However the ship is lost and Nausicaä, Chikuku and Charuka flee on Mehve. The suriving
                mould reaches the ground and starts to spread.

                Charuka debates with himself on whether to kill Nausicaä, but she is protected by Chikuku. When a Dorok
                Flying Jar happens to pass, Charuka takes Nausicaä and Chikuku up with him to a Dorok flying fortress,
                that also is carrying fungal spores. Knowing them fungus not to be stable, Nausicaa drops the
                reactivating fungal mass out the window. Charuka is now convinced that Miralupa's plan to use forest
                fungus as a weapon is fundamentally insecure, and decides to support Nausicaä's plan and stay to defend
                the people.
